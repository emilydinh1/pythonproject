**Hereâ€™s the scenario:** you work for a medium sized company that sells widgets directly to consumers through brick-and-mortar retail stores. The marketing department wants to try a new promotional campaign to ramp up direct internet sales, but needs better data about current traffic to your website. Your boss has asked you to take the HTTP server logs from the webserver and provide some analytics to Marketing.

This is my python program that reads from http_access_log.txt and returns back the total amount of requests that were made and the total amount of requests that were made in the year '1995'.

When running this program, you may need to wait until the dots finishing printing to see the last year requests and the total requests.
